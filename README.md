My food truckapp app

This app is written in backbone and php
It makes use of the soda api to retrieve the food trucks information

The app by default gets the trucks located in a bounded box (Will work on getting that fixed)

You can click on a location on a map in San Francisco and the pointer will go to that location and display near by food trucks.

If you click on the food trcuk icon on the map you can see info about that truck

It allows for different types of filtering and searching. 
You can filter based on a strrt name, food type.
You can also search by typing in a food truck name. Auto complete starts after the 3 letter typed in.

It also allows the user to use his location(Will work only if located in San Francisco)

The site is hosted on Heroku -> https://shrouded-temple-3292.herokuapp.com/food_trucks.php
It is also accessible on github ->
